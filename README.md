# C#/.NET Console App using Ethos APIs

This integration replaces the manual CSV workflow with an API-based workflow to streamline data transfer between Colleague SaaS and eLumen for Oakland Community College 

The purpose of this integration is to automate data synchronization between Colleague SaaS and eLumen, replacing the manual CSV upload process with a more efficient API-based workflow. 

Ethos Data Connect will retrieve data from Colleague SaaS using Ethos APIs, transform the data as required, and format it appropriately for eLumen APIs. This approach ensures compatibility, compliance, and efficient communication between the systems.

Please see OCCREC.mp4 for a live demonstration.
